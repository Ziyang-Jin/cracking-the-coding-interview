When I saw my friends practicing problems in the book "Cracking the Coding Interview", I thought that I didn't even need such a book because I was pursuiting pure computer science and pure programming skills without being a utilitarian. The truth has proven me wrong. I do need practice and I do need to get an internship. I am not that good as I thought I could be. 

So I would try to solve the problems without looking at the solution and hopefully my own solution is usually as good as the official answer. If not, it means I really need to learn.
